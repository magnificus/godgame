Series " OpenGL From Zero To Hero" - Chapter I

This is the source code that accompanies the series "OpenGL From Zero To Hero" 
from http://in2gpu.com blog Chapter I, written by Sergiu Craitoiu and Vlad Badoiu. 
Technical proofreading, editing, and advice is done by Michael Pohoreski.

All tutorials can be found right here: http://in2gpu.com/opengl-3/

Note!!! This is a beginner chapter and shows just the basic OpenGL functionality.
In this tutorials I wanted to include a basic engine architecture which can give a launch pad for beginners.
In the last part I also told what are the issues with this engine and what can you do to improve it and make it better.
